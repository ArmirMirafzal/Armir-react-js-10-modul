## Fundamental of Redux

        ✅ Redux Architecture
             🔴 store 👍🏻
             🔴 reducer (Event handler) 👍🏻
             🔴 action (Event) 👍🏻
             🔴 dispatch 👍🏻

        ✅ First Redux Application
             🔴 Steps
                🫰 Design the store 👍🏻
                🫰 Define the actions
                🫰 Create a reducer
                🫰 Set up the store
             🔴 Create a reducer
             🔴 Create a store
             🔴 Dispatching actions
             🔴 Subscribe to store
             🔴 Action types
             🔴 Action creators
             🔴 Implement resolving a bug

## Building Redux from scratch

        ✅ Redux Store
        ✅ Private properties
        ✅ Create Dispatch and GetState
        ✅ Subscribing to store
